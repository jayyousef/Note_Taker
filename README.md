## Description <a name="introduction"></a>
This project full stack web application will provide an area of a webpage for the user to enter a Title and note description and save it to a DB file using express for navigation so that they can store their notes while accessing the app from any page and click on the notes to view them later as a reminder. 

### Motivation
This project is meant to help users who need a place to write notes for themselves to come back to later. When they no longer need the note, they can delete it from the server.

### Problem Solved
This app will help the end user have a space where they can stores their notes so they can remember important information.
